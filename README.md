# Blog-Website
I am using PHP and MySQL for the backend of the blogging website and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little JQuery for the frontend design of the website.
Here, a user, guest, and the admin can read posts, see pictures, search on particular topics from the blogging web page. 
Only the admin can manage the posts, topics, users by using the features like to add, edit, delete, publish or unpublish.
These web application is user friendly for reading and writing posts.
