# Blog-Website
Blog website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend and PHP, MYYSQL for the backend.

I am working on my first pfoject to build a blogging web application where a users can read and the admins can write the posts. 
The motive behind this project was to create an environment where a users can share their life-time journal through posts. But here, I am using PHP and MYSQL for backend and still need to do lots of modification to the project.
